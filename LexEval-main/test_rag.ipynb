Special relativity introduced a new framework for all of physics by proposing new concepts of space and time.  Some then-accepted physical theories were inconsistent with that framework; a key example was Newton\\'s theory of gravity, which describes the mutual attraction experienced by bodies due to their mass.\\nSeveral physicists, including Einstein, searched for a theory that would reconcile Newton\\'s law of gravity and special relativity.  Only Einstein\\'s theory proved to be consistent with experiments and observations. To understand the theory\\'s basic ideas, it is instructive to follow Einstein\\'s thinking between 1907 and 1915, from his simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall to his fully geometric theory of gravity.\\n\\n\\n=== Equivalence principle ===\\n\\nA person in a free-falling elevator experiences weightlessness; objects either float motionless or drift at constant speed.  Since everything in the elevator is falling together, no gravitational effect can be observed.  In this way, the experiences of an observer in free fall are indistinguishable from those of an observer in deep space, far from any significant source of gravity.  Such observers are the privileged (\"inertial\") observers Einstein described in his theory of special relativity: observers for whom light travels along straight lines at constant speed.\\nEinstein hypothesized that the similar experiences of weightless observers and inertial observers in special relativity represented a fundamental property of gravity, and he made this the cornerstone of his theory of general relativity, formalized in his equivalence principle.  Roughly speaking, the principle states that a person in a free-falling elevator c',\n",

In his theory, he showed that gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light. Soon afterwards, Einstein started thinking about how to incorporate gravity into his relativistic framework. In 1907, beginning with a simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall (FFO), he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity. After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations, which form the core of Einstein\\'s general theory of relativity.

He also mentioned three classical tests with comments:\\n\\n\"The chief attraction of the theory lies in its logical completeness. If a single one of the conclusions drawn from it proves wrong, it must be given up; to modify it without destroying the whole structure seems to be impossible.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Perihelion precession of Mercury ===\\n\\nUnder Newtonian physics, an object in an (isolated) two-body system, consisting of the object orbiting a spherical mass, would trace out an ellipse with the center of mass of the system at a focus of the ellipse. The point of closest approach, called the periapsis (or when the central body is the Sun, perihelion), is fixed. Hence the major axis of the ellipse remains fixed in space. Both objects orbit around the center of mass of this system, so they each have their own ellipse. However, a number of effects in the Solar System cause the perihelia of planets to precess (rotate) around the Sun in the plane of their orbits, or equivalently, cause the major axis to rotate about the center of mass, hence changing its orientation in space. The principal cause is the presence of other planets which perturb one another\\'s orbit. Another (much less significant) effect is solar oblateness.\\nMercury deviates from the precession predicted from these Newtonian effects. This anomalous rate of precession of the perihelion of Mercury\\'s orbit was first recognized in 1859 as a problem in celestial mechanics, by Urbain Le Verrier. His re-analysis of available timed observations of transits of Mercury over the Sun\\'s disk from 1697 to 1848 showed that the actual rate of the precession disagreed from that predicted from Newton\\'s theory by 38″ (arcseconds) per tropical century (later re-estimated at 43″ by Simon Newcomb in 1882).
